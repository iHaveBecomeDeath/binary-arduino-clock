I've tried to make it relatively general and configurable so as to make it useful for more developers, but my first priority here has been the needs of my own experiment and it's hardware centric design.\r\n\r\n[Picture](http://postimg.org/image/m7np9a4u1/)\r\n\r\nThe clock itself is relatively simple, housed in a wooden frame, but I've made some steps towards making it almost as user friendly as a \"normal\" 12/24h clock.\r\n\r\nCheck out the rs3231 branch for limited RTC support.\r\n\r\nRequirements: \r\n- Arduino\r\n- [Timer1 library](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Timer1)\r\n- 10 LEDs\r\n- a button or two\r\n- LCD display\r\n- lots of little cables\r\n- preferrably a breadboard or such\r\n","google":"UA-61323022-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
